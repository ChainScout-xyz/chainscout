# Solution

**1. Select onchain actions to analyze**

This could be something as simple as DAI transfer or Swap on Uniswap.

We can find users/wallets who have had the onchain action

**2. Filter the analyzed data**

You can filter those addresses by checking if they have ENS, Lens etc‚Ä¶

**3. Create a campaign**

Select how you want to reach your target and set up the incentive

**4. Reward your users**

Users can claim the reward once they complete the onchain action
